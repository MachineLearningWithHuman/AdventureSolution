<h2> Part-01 Understand The problem</h2>
Let's say I have a client who's requirement is to prediction of energy demand in India in Renewable sector .
Now things to ask :
<li>1. Where in india the client is most interested in?</li>
<li>2. Is there any particular aspect </li>
<li>let's say The client has nothing to say or offer he is as dumb as PMO so we have to define the whole project charter and do it by the weekend.</li>

<h2> Part-02 Data Defination</h2>
<li>For data we are assuming the client had not provided his/her database connection he is new in this field so we will look into internet find data document it here and proceed further.</li>
